A youth cohort study has shown that although participation in recreational activities is essential for well-being, student time spent pursuing social activities has declined since the COVID-19 pandemic, causing higher levels of loneliness, depression and anxiety. We found that, despite 70% of student respondents expressing interest in pursuing social activities, 60% struggle to attend events due to their busy schedules, 40% due to affordability, and 34% due to travel. Currently, multiple online platforms are required to find interest-based communities, find group availability, determine travel time and research into activity costs. This is inefficient, causing a frustrating, bothersome and disjointed experience.

With these user needs in mind, we have created IRL. 

IRL helps university students stay socially active by making it quick and easy to discover, join and organise recreational activities. Designed for students, by students, IRL helps users find events within their preferred interests, proximity, price range and availability, providing opportunities to connect with other like-minded students. Users can also conveniently bring their event ideas to life by creating events on the app with integrated planning tools, providing a seamless event organisation experience.
